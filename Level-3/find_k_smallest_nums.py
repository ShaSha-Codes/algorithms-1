# Description:
# Find k smallest numbers from an unsorted array.
#
# Approach:
# Quick sort approach is used. The idea is, not to do complete quicksort, but
# stop at the point where pivot itself is kâ€™th smallest element. All elements
# from 0 to pivot will be k smallest numbers. Also, not to recur for both left
# and right sides of pivot, but recur for one of them according to the position
# of pivot.
#
# Note:
# For k largest numbers, we can find (n-k) smallest num - which is
# same as k largest.
#
# Reference:
# Method 4: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kth-smallestlargest-element-unsorted-array/
#
# Heap method is also given at above link which solves problem in
# O(k + (n-k)logk) complexity in worst case.
#
# Complexity:
# Average case - O(N)
# Worst case - O(N^2)
