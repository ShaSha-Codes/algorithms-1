 * Description:
 * Imagine you are reading in a stream of integers. Periodically, you wish to be
 * able to look up the rank of a number x (the number of values less than or
 * equal to x). Implement the data structures and algorithms to support these
 * operations. That is, implement the method track(int x), which is called when
 * each number is generated, and the method getRankOfNumber(int x), which
 * returns the number of values less than or equal to x (not including x
 * itself).
 * EXAMPLE
 * Stream (in order of appearance) : 5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 9, 7, 13, 3
 * getRankOfNumber(1) = 0
 * getRankOfNumber(3) = 1
 * getRankOfNumber(4) = 3
 *
 * Implementation:
 * Requirement is just to store the elements in sorted order and return index of
 * the item whose rank is required but as items are generated periodically,
 * using an array would be costly as shifting would be required to insert new
 * element at correct(to maintain sorted order) place.
 *
 * So to overcome this problem we can use binary search tree and store
 * additional info (number of nodes in left sub tree, left_size) with data.
 * We can track and update left_size of each node on every insert operation with
 * below approach while inserting in BST:
 * - Increment parent node's left_size if next element needs to be inserted in
 *   left sub tree.
 *
 * While fetching rank we just have to add left_size when traversing in right
 * sub tree.
 *
 * Note:
 * Another approach would be to keep count of each node so while inserting we
 * can increment count if same node is inserted and while fetching rank, we can
 * add up counts of all nodes being traversed: Level-3/rank_from_stream.py
 *
 * Complexity:
 * Insert: O(log(n)), find rank: O(log(n))
