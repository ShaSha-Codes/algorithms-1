# Description:
# Implement disjoint sets(union find) data structure.
# Disjoint sets are useful to maintain groups, check for membership and update
# membership
#
# Approach:
# Implemented using arrays
# - parent array keeps parent of an element
# - rank array keeps rank of subset
#
# Find is used to find which group a element belongs to, returns parent of that
# group. This function also does path compression step
#
# Union is used to merge 2 elements to a single group if already not in the
# same group otherwise merges them to single group using rank
